Finger Exercise 1

    1. What is the difference between an Algorithm and a Program?
    
    [x] An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.
    [] An algorithm is limited to mathematical operation, a program can specify all kinds of operations.
    [] An algorithm makes a slow program run fast.
    [] An algorithm deals with computer hardware, a program deals with computer software.
    
    2. True or False? A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.
    
    [x] True
    [] False
    
    3. True or False? Computer Science is the study of how to build efficient machines that run programs.
    
    [] True
    [x] False
    
    4. The two things every computer can do are:
    
    [x] Perform calculations
    [] Convert electricity to numbers
    [] Display results to a screen
    [x] Remember the results


Finger Exercise 2



    1. Declarative knowledge refers to statements of fact.
    
    [x] True
    [] False
    
    2. Imperative knowledge refers to 'how to' methods.
    
    [x] True
    [] False
    
    3. A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the computer cannot generate one on its own.
    
    [x] True
    [] False

Finger Exercise 3
    
    1. True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.
    
    [] True
    [x] False
    
    2. True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.
    
    [] True
    [x] False
    
    3. A program counter
    
    [] counts the number of primitive operations executed by the program.
    [] counts the number of primitive operations comprising a complex operation.
    [x] points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.
    [] remembers how many times a program has been executed.
    
    4. What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?
    
    [] The computer tests each instruction to ensure it will not harm the circuitry.
    [] The computer executes the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line.
    [x] The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
    [] The computer slowly executes instructions so that we can follow its progress, rather than running a program at full speed.
    
    5. True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.
    
    [] True
    [x] False


Finger Exercise 4

    1. Determines whether a string is legal
    
    [x] Syntax
    [] Static semantics
    [] Semantics
    
    2. Determines whether a string has meaning
    
    [] Syntax
    [x] Static semantics
    [] Semantics
    
    3. Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence
    
    [] Syntax
    [] Static semantics
    [x] Semantics
